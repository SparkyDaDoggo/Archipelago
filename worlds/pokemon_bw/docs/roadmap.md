# Roadmap for Pokémon BW AP

## Some headline

The "barely working" version will still be playable to goal, so it will start with 0.1.0.

Every major feature will increase the version by +0.1.

However, do not confuse that with the semantic version naming: `major.minor.build`

Version 1.0.0 will happen when certain features are implemented.

## Road to 1.0.0

### First version

  - Goals: Ghetsis, Alder, Cynthia, TM/HM hunt, seven sages
